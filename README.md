# Minecraft MakeCode: Command Kits
# Update again!!
This project is a collection of powerful command kits for Minecraft Education Edition, built using MakeCode. Each command gives you a specific set of gear or blocks to help with building, fighting, or just having fun.

## The Kits

-   **`.kit`**: This is your ultimate survival kit. It provides a full set of max-enchanted Netherite gear and essential items like totems and enchanted golden apples, all with the custom name "paw's op kit loot."

-   **`.equip_kit`**: This is a standalone command that automatically equips your gear. Run this after using the `.kit` command to instantly put on your armor and place your tools in your hotbar.

-   **`.illegals_kit`**: This is the first "illegal" kit. It gives you overpowered "32k" weapons and armor that are not possible to obtain in a standard survival world.

-   **`.illegals_kit_2`**: This kit provides a variety of special and unobtainable blocks, including Command Blocks, Barrier Blocks, and End Portal Frames.

-   **`.buildingKit`**: This command gives you a comprehensive set of building blocks, including normally unobtainable ones, and a custom "Building Kit" shulker box.
